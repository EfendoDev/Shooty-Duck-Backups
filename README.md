# Shooty-Duck-Backups
a backup of all the shooty duck games' source code that i still have

### The Shooty Duck 2: Lost Feathers backup is the *redeployed* version which is a partial very bad remaster based off the mobile version and loosely ported to pc, missing sprint, dont fix
another thing with the sd2lf:r backup is taht because of githubs upload limit i dont know if *all* files got uploaded. However i made another copy of this project on [MEGA](https://mega.nz/folder/KlphDBYR#r7SBEHoeYjwmaWlt-Wk1FQ)
